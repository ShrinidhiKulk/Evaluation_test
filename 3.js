/* Imagine you're making a plan to fetch some data from the internet. You want to do this in JavaScript. Now, sometimes fetching data can take a bit of time because the internet isn't always lightning-fast. JavaScript doesn't like waiting around, though, so it has this cool feature called async and await to help out.

Think of async as a way to tell JavaScript, "Hey, this function might take a little while, so don't worry if it doesn't finish right away." It's like telling a friend, "I'll call you back, but it might take me a minute to finish what I'm doing."

Now, await is like a pause button for JavaScript. When you use await inside an async function, it's saying, "Hold up, let's not move on until we get the result we're waiting for." It's like waiting for a text reply before moving on to the next part of a conversation.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

Let's say you're trying to fetch some information from a website. You write a function called fetchData that does this for you. But since fetching data can take a few moments, you mark this function as async. This tells JavaScript, "Hey, be patient, this might take a bit."*/

	async function processData() {
 	 try {
    	const data = await fetchData();
   	 // Now, we've got the data, so we can move on!
   	 console.log(data);
 	} catch (error) {
    	// Oops, something went wrong!
   	 console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
 	 }
	}

/*Here, processData is marked as async because it's doing something that might take a bit of time. When it reaches the await fetchData() line, it's like saying, "Okay, let's wait here until fetchData finishes getting the data." Once fetchData is done and hands over the data, we can continue with the rest of the processData function.

So, async and await help JavaScript handle asynchronous tasks in a way that's easier to understand, just like how you might pause a conversation until you get the reply you're waiting for.*/
